Here is my content page. For assignment 1, majority of my code is the same as the example videos. I downloaded and put the example files in my src so they would be easier to access for me, but for cleanliness and to avoid problems with multiple webGL intiliazations I only load asgn1.js and the class files in the html. For making the drawing
button I asked ChatGPT to make some code that will print the coordinates of the triangles I place into console, so hard coding it was easier. That way I could draw it
with the program and then do it, instead of 1 by 1 coding the coordinates and size.

Notes to grader: 
For the 'awesomeness' part, I just added a transparency/opacity slider. They are pretty much the same thing but I called it opacity because I start at value 100 (lowering it makes it more transparent so it feels more right to call it opacity).
